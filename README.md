## Netflix-clone 

## Description

This project combines modern web development tools and technologies to create a functional and visually pleasing Netflix clone. This project integrates user authentication, retrieval and display of movie and TV show data from the TMDB API, and utilizes Firestore for efficient data management. With a responsive design and the convenience of Tailwind CSS, we aim to deliver a seamless user experience while showcasing the power of Firebase as a back-end solution for web applications.
